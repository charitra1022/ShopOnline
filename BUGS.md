## Active Bugs

2. Slow speed of product list auto scroller
3. Green text on card hover. [Reference](https://shoponline-ca.herokuapp.com/ram/)
4. Carousel video and auto scroll not working on some mobiles
5. Page not found custom page
6. Django debug error custom page
8. Django custom error page
9. Mobile size UI enhancements
10. Invoice is generated only for 1 product. Same txn id is used for multiple products in same cart, so pdf gets replaced for evry product in cart! Can be solved by creating another model separately for invoices.
